# HALER TRANSPORT PDF FILE RENAMER

Automated PDF File renaming for Haller Transport scanned files.
## Requirements

Following third party tools are required:

- Poppler (tested with v22.04.0, might work with other versions too)
- Tesseract OCR (https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdoc)
## Installation
- install Tesseract in the default location (Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\)
- put the poppler folder inside the root directory of the program. Folder needs to be renamed to "poppler-22.04.0", no matter the version you're using)
- run the program from the .exe
## Usage

- Select folder containing the PDF Files that need to be renamed.
- Click on convert and wait, the program might freeze for a few minutes. This is normal, it's calculating stuff :)
- renamed files will be placed in [program-location]\renamed

- whatever you do, do NOT delete any folders or rename them, it will BREAK the program.
